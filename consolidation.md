# Consolidation: It's time for celebration

Right now there are two great redis clients around and both have some advantages above each other. We speak about [node_redis](https://github.com/NodeRedis/node_redis) and ioredis. So after talking to each other about how we could improve in working together we (that is [@BridgeAR](https://github.com/BridgeAR) and [@luin](https://github.com/luin)) decided to work towards a single library on the long run. But step by step.

First of all, we want to split small parts of our libraries into others so that we're both able to use the same code. Those libraries are going to be maintained under the NodeRedis organization. This is going to reduce the maintance overhead, allows others to use the very same code, if they need it and it's way easier for others to contribute to both libraries.

We're very happy about this step towards working together as we both want to give you the best redis experience possible.

If you want to join our cause by help maintaining something, please don't hesitate to contact either one of us.
